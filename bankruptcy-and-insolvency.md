# Bankruptcy and Insolvency

Bankruptcy is a process where the debtor is publicly recognised (i.e. by
a court order) as unable to pay their debts (i.e. insolvent). The Court
usually appoints an Official Assignee to administer the bankruptcy
estate, which involves the selling of assets, registration of creditors'
claims and paying out dividends to his creditors.

This chapter is divided into three sections:

1.  Bankruptcy Procedure
2.  Effects of Bankruptcy
3.  Commonly Asked Questions Related to Bankruptcy

This chapter deals with the bankruptcy of individual persons, as
different legal provisions apply to the insolvency of corporations (the
Companies Act) and limited liability partnerships (Limited Liability
Partnerships Act).

**NOTE:** As of July 2014, the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office
(IPTO) is in the midst of reviewing the insolvency regime in Singapore
and aims to introduce an Insolvency Act that covers both personal and
corporate insolvencies.

## Procedure

**How is a Person Declared Bankrupt?**

A person is declared bankrupt on the order of the **High Court** if he
is unable to pay his **debts of at least S\$10,000**. This is usually
done upon the application or petition of a creditor, although the debtor
may file a bankruptcy application on his or her own behalf. The creditor
taking out the application for bankruptcy would have served the debtor a
notice known as a **Statutory Demand**, demanding payment from the
debtor. If the payment is not met within a term of 21 days, the debtor
is presumed unable to pay his debts and a petition will be filed in
Court and the hearing date given. If payment is not made by the hearing
date, the Court may proceed to make a **Bankruptcy Order**.

For bankruptcy applications filed after 18 May 2009 and in which the
debt owed does not exceed S\$100,000, the debtor will be referred to the
Official Assignee for an assessment of eligibility and suitability to
enter into a **Debt Repayment Scheme (‘DRS’)**. In such cases, the
bankruptcy application shall be adjourned for a period of 6 months or as
otherwise ordered by the High Court.

**The Official Assignee**

The **Official Assignee (‘OA’)** is a public servant and an officer of
the Court. In the vast majority of cases, the Court will appoint him as
the trustee and receiver of the estate once a Bankruptcy Order is made.
The OA will administer all of the insolvent person's financial affairs,
including selling of assets, registration of creditors' claims and
paying out dividends to his creditors. Alternatively, the Court may
appoint a private trustee in lieu of the OA if the creditors so request.

The OA's role is two-fold:

-   To realise as anym assets as possible for distribution to creditors;
    and
-   To assist the insolvent in obtaining a discharge from bankruptcy.

As an administrator of the bankruptcy estate, the OA also has the duty
to **investigate an insolvent's conduct** while he remains a bankrupt.
Additional duties of the OA include adjudication of the creditors'
claims, payment of dividends to creditors and applying to the High Court
for an insolvent's discharge from bankruptcy. In situations where there
are disputes between a bankrupt and his creditors regarding the quantum
of debt or the amount of payment of the debt, the OA will **act as
mediator** to assist in reaching a mutually acceptable proposal.

**When a Statement of Affairs is Required and How to File It**

A written Statement of Affairs (the ‘**Statement’**) is required when:

(a) A bankruptcy application is adjourned and referred to an OA for
    determining eligibility and suitability for a DRS. In such a case,
    the OA shall give notice in writing requiring the Statement; or
(b) A bankruptcy order is issued.

**Contents of a Statement:** Under Section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap
20), once declared bankrupt, the ‘insolvent’ is required to disclose to
the OA via the Statement all of his assets, creditors, debts and other
liabilities. This must be done within 21 days of the date of the
Bankruptcy Order being made against the insolvent person.

If the insolvent person is a partner of a firm which has been declared
insolvent, he will have to submit a Statement stating his personal
assets and liabilities and a joint Statement of the insolvent firm's
assets and liabilities (unless the joint Statement has been submitted by
another partner of the firm).

A 'Guide to Completing Your Statement of Affairs' will be sent to the
insolvent together with his first appointment letter to see an officer
of the OA upon the insolvent being made bankrupt. It will assist the
insolvent in completing parts of the Statement when the insolvent attens
his first interview, and will save him considerable time at the OA's
office.

Please note that it is an offence punishable with imprisonment for a
term not exceeding 2 years or to a fine not exceeding S\$10,000 or both
if the insolvent, without reasonable excuse, fails to submit a Statement
of Affairs to the OA or submits a Statement which is false, misleading
or contains any material omission.

## Categorisation of Insolvents

Insolvents are categorised based on their conduct during bankruptcy.
This categorisation helps to streamline case management and allow
insolvents who show satisfactory conduct to have certain privileges (see
below). This streamlining will also facilitate insolvents in getting a
discharge from bankruptcy expeditiously.

The following are some of the factors that the OA will consider:

| **Green Zone**                     | **Red Zone** |
| ---------------------------------  | ------------ |
| Statement of Affairs filed on time | Statement of Affairs **not** filed on time |
| Gainfully employed                 | Unemployed (with no good reasons for unemployment) |
| Regular in making instalment payments | Irregular in making instalment payments or no payments made at all |
| Instalment amount is commensurate to income and needs of family | Instalment amount is **not** commensurate to income and needs of family |
| Timely submission of Income and Expenditure statements | Irregular submission of Income and Expenditure statements |
| Is co-operative with the OA | Is uncooperative with the OA |
| No pending warrant of arrest | Outstanding warrant of arrest |
| No pending prosecution action | Pending prosecution action |
| No complaint under investigation | Complaint under investigation |
| No offences committed under the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20) | Has committed offences under the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20) |
| Full disclosure of assets (both local and overseas) | Non-disclosure of assets (local and overseas) |

### Benefits Of Being In The Green Zone

* Expeditious processing of online applications for permission to travel. May be given permit up to 1 year to travel to any country
* Green Zone classification can help an insolvent obtain a discharge after 3 years in bankruptcy if liabilities are *less than* S$500,000
* Recommended for discharge by **Court** after 3 years in bankruptcy if liabilities is *more than* S$500,000
* Expeditious processing of insolvent’s application to buy and sell a HDB flat within 7 working days
* Buying a HDB flat: The OA’s consent is required only for the purchase of a HDB flat larger than a 5-room flat.
* Expeditious processing of insolvent’s application to run/manage a business or act as a director within 14 working days
* Submission of Income and Expenditure statement on a yearly basis

### Disincentives To Those in the Red Zone

* Will generally not be granted permission to travel
* A Red Zone insolvent will generally not be recommended for discharge by the   
Certificate of the OA or by Court. He or she can only obtain a discharge through  
full settlement of debts or through a voluntary arrangement accepted by his creditors.
* Applications to purchase or sell a HDB flat will be processed within 14 days or longer
* Insolvent will **not** be given permission to manage a business or act as a director
* Submission of Income and Expenditure statement on a six-monthly basis or more frequent basis

### Re-categorisation

An insolvent who has been categorised in the Red
Zone can, if he or she makes an effort to demonstrate good conduct
during bankruptcy, be re-categorised into the Green Zone.

## Administration Costs & Fees

**1. Cost incurred by the petitioning creditor**

**Deposit:** Under the Bankruptcy (Fees) Rules, any creditor or debtor
who wishes to file a bankruptcy petition in the High Court must pay a
deposit of **S\$1,600** to the OA. The petitioning creditor may recover
his deposit from the insolvent if there are sufficient funds in the
insolvent's estate.

**In case of withdrawal:** In the event that a bankruptcy petition is
withdrawn or dismissed by the High Court, the OA will retain S\$250 as
preliminary administration costs under the Bankruptcy (Fees) Rules and
refund S\$1,350 to the petitioning creditor.

**2. Cost incurred by the insolvent**

The insolvent bears the costs incurred by the petitioning creditor, i.e.
the petitioning creditor's deposit, solicitor's fees and disbursements
incurred in obtaining the Bankruptcy Order.

The OA also deducts a realisation fee from proceeds of assets realised,
or deposits placed into the insolvent's estate. Distribution fees are
also levied on dividends distributed to creditors. Please check with the
Insolvency & Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO) (<https://www.ipto.gov.sg/>)
for an indication of the current fees. [^1]

## Concerns of Creditors

**Creditors should look to bankruptcy only as a last resort**

Creditors should not rush to take up bankruptcy proceedings immediately
upon default of payment by debtors, but should look to bankruptcy as a
last resort for debt recovery and only after all other avenues for
recovery have failed.

**Alternative arrangements:** Creditors are advised to consider a debt
settlement proposal, Voluntary Arrangement or Debt Repayment Scheme
(DRS) proposed by debtors under Part V of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20)
carefully. This can be a very cost effective way of recovering debt
through settlement instead of bankruptcy proceedings. Please refer to
the next section on “Alternatives to Bankruptcy” for more information.

**1. Duties of secured creditors**

Secured creditors (e.g. banks or other financial institutions to whom
the debtor has mortgaged or pledged his property or goods in order to
secure credit facilities) should take possession of the property or
goods upon the bankruptcy of the debtor. If the property is worth more
than the amount of money secured against it, the balance from the
proceeds of sale must be remitted to OA.

Secured creditors must realise their security within 6 months from the
date of the Bankruptcy Order or such extended period as the OA may
allow. Otherwise, they will not be entitled to claim any interest
subsequent to the date of the Bankruptcy Order.

**2. Filing your claim against the insolvent**

Once a debtor is declared bankrupt by the High Court, his creditors can
**no longer** commence or continue with any legal action against the
insolvent to recover monetary claims that arose before his insolvency
without leave of the Court. Instead, creditors are required to submit to
the OA a Proof of Debt (Form 23) and give an account of their claims
against the insolvent, along with the relevant supporting documents
(e.g. invoices, receipts, agreements, judgments). The petitioning
creditor should also file his Proof of Debt against the insolvent.
Creditors who change their address after filing their Proof of Debt must
notify the OA.

Debts that are incurred after the date of Bankruptcy Order are not
provable (claimable) against the bankrupt's estate.

**3. Receiving dividends from the bankruptcy estate**

Notices will be published in the Straits Times to inform creditors of
the OA's intention to declare dividend to creditors. This is done when
there are sufficient funds in the bankruptcy estate for a dividend
pay-out or for the insolvent to make a debt settlement offer.

Creditors are advised to carefully consider any debt settlement offer of
insolvents and to accept any invitation to mediation if proposed.

## Mediation in Individual Insolvency

The primary interest of all insolvents is for a quick and early
discharge from their bankruptcies and for creditors, the early
settlement and repayment of their debts.

Mediation has always played a central role in the administration of debt
settlement proposals. The OA is therefore provides a wide range of
mediation services to insolvents and their creditors through the
Bankruptcy Mediation Unit.

**The Bankruptcy Mediation Unit**

The unit consists of a panel of mediators who assist the parties to
reach mutually acceptable resolutions of their disputes through the use
of mediation.

The unit provides mediation services to:

(a) Resolve the amount of debt owed by the insolvents to their
    creditors; and
(b) Negotiate on debt settlement proposals between the insolvents and
    their creditors.

## Alternatives to Bankruptcy

**A. Alternative Arangements for Creditors**

Creditors should only commence bankruptcy proceedings after all avenues
for recovering debts have been explored and proven unsuccessful, as
bankruptcy is not an instant remedy for the recovery of debts.

*Reasons to advise creditors why they should not rush to commence
bankruptcy proceedings:*

-   High cost of bankruptcy proceedings
-   Full recovery of debts is unlikely
-   Loss of interest, as interest on unsecured debts ceases to run upon
    the making of the Bankruptcy Order
-   Effect on insolvent’s earning capacity
-   No priority for unsecured creditors
-   Discharge may be ordered by the Court or the OA

**1. Private arrangements**

Creditors should discuss with the insolvent his financial position and
work out arrangements for repayment of debts. This may encourage the
insolvent finding ways to settle your claim in order to **avoid legal
proceedings**. Debtors who are entrepreneurs also have a fair chance to
pull themselves around. A private arrangement may be reached for the
purposes of allowing the debtor to pay debts by instalments, reschedule
payments or obtaining an extension of time to liquidate assets.

**2. Voluntary arrangement**

A voluntary arrangement is a formal arrangement between the debtor and
his creditors in respect of repaying the debts, subject to supervision
by a nominee. The proposal for a voluntary arrangement must provide for
the nominee (who must be a registered public accountant, an advocate and
solicitor or a person gazetted by the Minister who has consented to
being appointed as such), who shall be appointed to supervise the debt
and settlement proposal.

If a debtor applies to court to make a proposal for a voluntary
arrangement under Part V of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), the creditor
should participate in the creditors' meeting to consider the proposal.

> **Disclosure requirements:** The debtor is required to disclose his or
> her assets and liabilities, and propose ways of settling his or her
> debts. If the voluntary arrangement is accepted by creditors and
> implemented successfully, it will benefit both creditors and debtor.
> If not, the debtor runs the risk of bankruptcy. Under Section 56 of
> the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), if the debtor fails to comply with any of
> the obligations undertaken in the voluntary arrangement, any of the
> creditor’s party to the same may make a bankruptcy application against
> the debtor.

**B. Alternative Arrangements for Debtors**

*Compelling reasons why bankruptcy should be avoided by debtors as far
as possible*

-   Social stigma
-   Your assets will become vested in the OA and divisible among
    creditors
-   You must file Statements of Affairs and income and expenditure
    statements, and your financial affairs will be subject to thorough
    investigations by the OA
-   You must make monthly payments to the bankruptcy estate
-   You must disclose your bankruptcy when obtaining credit of &gt;\$500
-   Your correspondence may be redirected to the OA (Bankruptcy Act (Cap
    20), Section 115(1))
-   Restrictions on overseas travel; possible impounding of your travel
    document (Section 116(2))
-   You may not manage a business or act as a director of companies
    without approval of the court or the OA
-   Certain behaviour such as gambling, seeking credit or engaging in
    business may constitute a criminal offense under the Act (Part X)
-   Even after discharge from bankruptcy, potential creditors may be
    dissuaded from granting you credit

**1. Private arrangements**

**Process:** A debtor can enter into private arrangements with creditors
to pay debts by instalments, to reschedule repayments, or to give
extension of time to liquidate assets or seek other financial sources to
repay debts.

**Responsibility of debtor under private arrangements:** Inform
creditors truthfully and completely of his latest financial position and
provide accurate information and documentary evidence readily to prove
one’s current financial position. Debtors should always undertake
serious efforts to comply with the new repayment arrangements.

**2. Voluntary arrangement**

You may apply to court for an interim order for voluntary arrangement
under Part V of Bankruptcy Act. You must disclose your assets and
liabilities, and make a proposal on how you intend to settle your debts
with your creditors. Under no circumstances should any false
representation be made or any other fraud committed for the purpose of
obtaining the creditors’ approval of the proposed voluntary arrangement.

**3. Debt Repayment Scheme**

Debtors who have aggregate debts in an amount **no greater than
S\$100,000** may be eligible for a Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) under the
provisions of Part VA of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), subject to the
approval of the OA. Bankruptcy applications filed before 18 May 2009 are
not eligible for a DRS.

If the debtor meets the statutory criteria and is considered suitable
for a DRS by the OA, a repayment plan requiring regular debt repayments
over a fixed period of time will be reviewed by a OA and further by a
meeting of creditors presided by the OA. For the duration of the DRS,
the debtor is required to comply with the conditions set out in the plan
and failure to do so may prompt the OA to issue a Certificate of Failure
of the DRS, after which the DRS will cease and debtor may be declared
bankrupt.

**4. Court dispute resolution**

If you are being sued by creditors in civil proceedings, you may
negotiate with creditors for a settlement on repayment of debts and
avoid bankruptcy.

## How to be Discharged from Bankruptcy

Under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), there are three ways in which the
insolvent can be discharged from bankruptcy:

(a) Annulment of the bankruptcy order by Certificate of Annulment of the
    OA
(b) Discharge by the Court
(c) Discharge by Certificate of the OA

**NOTE:** There is no automatic discharge in Singapore.

**Preliminary steps to a discharge of bankruptcy**

**a. Advertisement of intention to declare a dividend:** In order to
ascertain the full extent of your liabilities, the OA is required to
advertise your intention to pay dividends to your creditors. The
estimated cost of the advertisement is \$350 and it will be published in
the Straits Times. Creditors have 14 days to file their claims (or
proofs of debt).

**b. Adjudicating or admitting claims:** After the claims of creditors
or proofs of debt have been received, you will be asked to examine these
claims at the IPTO website and state whether you admit or dispute them.
When this is done, the bankrupt will be informed whether he or she has
sufficient money to make full payment of his or her debts, or compute
the sum of money needed to raise the Offer of Composition or Scheme of
Arrangement.

**c. Procedures involved in full settlement:** If you have sufficient
funds to make a full payment, your creditors will be informed of the
amount you have admitted as owing them.

-   

    A 100% dividend will be declared to the creditors. The OA will issue

    :   a Certificate of Annulment to annul the Bankruptcy Order.

-   

    Any surplus monies in the bankruptcy estate account will be refunded

    :   after all fees and bills have been paid.

**1. Annulment of the bankruptcy order by Certificate of Annulment of
the OA**

The OA will issue a Certificate of Annulment if the insolvent’s **offer
of composition**, or **scheme of arrangement**, has been accepted by his
creditors, or if his debts have been paid in full.

-   An **Offer of Composition** is an offer to settle debts by payment
    of a fixed percentage of the debts to the creditors.
-   A **Scheme of Arrangement** means to settle debts by paying
    different percentages of the debts owed to different creditors. For
    example, one may have to settle the full sum owing to the
    Comptroller of Income Tax and may make a partial offer to the
    other creditors.

Acceptance of the composition or scheme must be made by a **special
resolution** approved in writing or passed at a general meeting of
creditors, and by a majority of the creditors (in number) that represent
at least three-fourths (3/4) of the value of the debt that has been
proven.

The OA may also issue a Certificate of Annulment of a Bankruptcy Order
under Section 123A of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20) when the debts
which have been proved and the expenses of the bankruptcy have been paid
as of the issuance of the Bankruptcy Order.

**Procedures Involved In Scheme of Arrangement or Offer of Composition**

If you do not have sufficient funds for full payment you may still
propose a debt settlement plan.

Your proposal will be forwarded to your creditors and they will be
invited to accept the offer. The proposal will be deemed as successful
if a majority in number of creditors that represent at least
three-fourths (3/4) in value of the bankrupt’s debts vote in favour.

Once a majority vote is obtained, the OA will declare a dividend and
discharge the bankrupt.

**2. Discharge by the Court**

The High Court may grant an Order of Discharge under Section 124 of the
Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20) at the request of the bankrupt, the OA or
any other person with an interest in the matter.

**Notice requirement:** Prior to granting a conditional or absolute
discharge, notice must be given to and the Court will hear the OA and
the creditors before deciding whether to grant the order of discharge or
not. The Court will consider such facts as: the bankrupt’s age, earning
capacity and assets before deciding whether to discharge him or her.

In addition, the Court will also consider the amount of payments he or
she has contributed for the benefit of his creditors, whether any
bankruptcy or other offences were committed, and generally, whether the
insolvent has co-operated fully with the OA in the administration of the
bankruptcy estate.

**3. Discharge by Certificate of the OA**

Under Section 125 of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20), the OA may, at his
or her own discretion, discharge an insolvent provided that a period of
3 years has passed since bankruptcy began and the proven debts are no
more than S\$500,000. In deciding whether to grant the Certificate of
Discharge to an insolvent, the OA will take into consideration, among
others, the following factors: the cause and period of bankruptcy, the
insolvent's assets and payments made to the bankruptcy estate, and the
bankrupt’s conduct and the level of co-operation with the OA.

It is therefore in the insolvent’s best interests to extend his fullest
co-operation to the OA in the administration of the insolvent’s affairs,
as this factor will weigh in his or her favour in evaluating discharge
from bankruptcy.

## Effects of Bankruptcy

### Rights and Responsibilities of an Insolvent

**1. Filing of Statement of Affairs**

Under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), the insolvent is required to disclose
fully all his or her assets and liabilities to the OA and submit a
written statement of his or her assets and liabilities (known as the
**Statement of Affairs**) within **21 days** from the date of the
Bankruptcy Order. This Statement of Affairs should be made under oath
and in the prescribed form.

The insolvent must ensure that letters from the OA to him or her are
answered promptly and that he or she attends at this office whenever
required, and that the Income and Expenditure Statements required by the
OA are provided on time. Any change in residential address should be
promptly reported to the OA. The insolvent has an obligation under the
Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) to assist in the administration of his or her
estate and it is in the insolvent’s best interest to do so.

**Failure to comply:** Failure to comply with the requirements to file
the Statement of Affairs, or the submission of a Statement of Affairs
that does not comply with legal requirements or that contains false or
misleading information is an offence punishable on conviction with
imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to \$10,000 or to both.

**2. Income and contributions**

If the insolvent is gainfully employed, he or she must make a monthly
contribution to his bankruptcy estate for the benefit of his creditors.
This will enable the OA to obtain the insolvent’s discharge from
insolvency as soon as possible. Please note that the amount of payments
the insolvent makes is also an important factor considered by the OA
when exercising his or her discretion whether to issue a certificate to
discharge him from bankruptcy.

The OA will assess the contribution, if any, that the insolvent will be
liable to pay each month out of his or her income after taking into
account what he or she reasonably needs to upkeep himself and his
family. To assist the OA in making this assessment, he or she must
provide on a 6-monthly basis (or as otherwise directed by the OA) an
account of all moneys and property which have come to his or her hands
for his or her own use during such time, and information about his or
her occupation, income and dependants.

To facilitate easy and regular payments of the insolvent’s income
contribution, the OA will allow him to operate a savings account and the
contribution will be deducted periodically through GIRO.

**Failure to comply:** Failure to comply with this requirement, or the
failure to pay to the OA the amounts that have not been expressly
expended for maintenance of the insolvent and his family, is an offence
punishable on conviction with imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to
\$10,000 or to both, and in the case of a continuing offense to a
further fine of up to \$200 per day.

### Creditors

Creditors can take no further legal proceedings against the insolvent to
recover any debts incurred before insolvency.

**Exception:** However, a very important exception to this concerns the
payment of fines for breaches of the law. A declaration of bankruptcy
does not protect the insolvent from the obligation to pay such fines,
including taxes due to the Inland Revenue Department, which must be
settled even after a discharge from insolvency.

If the insolvent receives any demand for payments, notice of court
action from creditors or is approached by creditors to whom the
insolvent owed money at the date of insolvency, he should advise the
creditors of his status as bankrupt and forward any documents received
to the OA.

**Secured Creditors**

Creditors who hold security (such as banks or other financial
institutions to whom the insolvent has mortgaged or pledged property or
goods in order to secure credit facilities) over the insolvent’s
property or goods have a right to sell such property or goods if the
bankrupt does not continue to meet the payments when they are due. If
the property or goods are worth more than the amount of money secured
against it, any balance from the proceeds of sale after discharging the
security will be accredited to the bankruptcy estate and utilised to pay
a dividend to other creditors.

Secured creditors should realize their security within **6 months** from
the date of the bankruptcy order or such extended time as the OA may
allow, otherwise they will not be entitled to claim any interest in
respect of their debts subsequent to the date of the bankruptcy order.

### Insolvent’s Assets

**Vesting of the insolvent’s property in the OA**

Under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), the OA takes over the title to the
insolvent’s assets and has the responsibility to realise them and pay a
dividend to the insolvent’s creditors. The insolvent cannot sell or deal
with any of his assets or items of value. Only the OA or a secured
creditor is able to do so (with respect to the secured property or
assets).

**Scope of “assets”:** Includes anything of value belonging to the
bankrupt at the date of insolvency, or obtained by him thereafter and
gifts given to him before his discharge from insolvency. The insolvent
must deliver up possession of these assets to the OA.

**Protected property**

Certain property is protected against the insolvent’s creditors by law,
which means it cannot be sold or taken over by the OA. Under the
Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20), limited tools of trade and possessions such as
furniture, clothing and provisions necessary for satisfying the domestic
needs of the bankrupt and his family remain with the bankrupt. Other
protected properties include:

-   Properties held in trust by the bankrupt, HDB flats (provided at
    least one of the owners is a Singapore citizen) orCentral Provident
    Fund (CPF) contributions
-   Life insurance policies which are expressed to be for the benefit of
    the insolvent’s spouse or children
-   Compensation awarded for legal actions due to personal injuries or
    wrongful acts against the bankrupt

**HDB Flats**

Special considerations may apply with regard to HDB flats. For more
information please see the section titled Obtaining OA's Approval To
Sell Or Buy A HDB Flat below.

### Restrictions on an Undischarged Insolvent

As an undischarged insolvent there are some things the bankrupt cannot
do. These include the following:

(a) Travelling overseas without the OA’s permission.

    \(b) Bringing any Court action, other than an action for damages or
    compensation in respect of personal injuries or wrongful acts against
    him, without the OA’s permission.

(b) Obtaining credit.

\(d) Acting as trustee or personal representative without the Court’s
permission.

\(e) Managing a business or corporation without the Court’s or OA’s
permission.

In addition to the above, other offences which relate to fraudulent acts
by insolvents and are punishable with imprisonment of up to 3 years or a
fine up to S\$10,000 or both are prescribed in the Bankruptcy Act (Cap
20), mainly in Part X of the same. These include, among others:

-   Non-disclosure of information relating to his affairs and making
    misrepresentations to the OA, e.g. making material omissions in any
    statement to the OA, concealment of assets or concealment of books
    and papers, destruction of books affecting your property or affairs.
-   Leaving or attempting to leave Singapore with his property in order
    to defraud his creditors (absconding with property).

### Opening An OA-Assisted Bank Account

Upon his bankruptcy, all the insolvent’s bank accounts will be
terminated. The OA will assist him in opening a new savings account.
This account will allow cash withdrawals, ATM facilities and GIRO
deductions. The following conditions will be imposed when opening the
new savings account:

-   The insolvent is required to pay his monthly instalments towards his
    bankruptcy estate via GIRO; and
-   He must furnish all information required by the OA in respect of the
    savings account.

If the above conditions are not complied with, the OA will close the
savings account.

**Procedure for opening a bank account and activating GIRO deductions:**

-   The insolvent will receive a letter from the OA addressed to the
    bank and a Direct Debit Authorisation ("DDA") form – the DDA form is
    to activate the GIRO deductions from the bank account to his
    bankruptcy estate for the benefit of his creditors
-   Within 14 days, the insolvent will have to present the OA's letter
    to the bank to open the savings account. He must:

    > a\. Make a photocopy of the first page of the bank passbook (the page
    > that contains your account information) and attach it to the DDA form.
    >
    > b\. Complete the DDA form by filing in item nos. (1) - (5), and ensure
    > that the signature at item (5) matches the signature in the
    > bank passbook.
    >
    > c\. Return the DDA form and the photocopy of the first page of the bank
    > passbook to the OA

-   The OA will notify the insolvent once the GIRO facilities
    is activated. Generally, it will take 8 weeks for the activation to
    take place.
-   **Note:** Until reception of notification, the insolvent will have
    to make his instalment payments via cash or Nets or cash card at the
    OA’s office.

**Making Monthly Instalment Payments Via GIRO**

> On receipt of the OA's notification, the insolvent must ensure that he
> maintains sufficient funds in the bank account before the 3rd or
> before the 16th day of each month.
>
> The GIRO deductions from the bank account into the bankruptcy estate
> account will take place between the **3rd - 7th day (1st attempt)** or
> the **16th - 20th day (2^nd^ attempt)** of each month. The second
> attempt will be made only when the first attempt to deduct the funds
> has failed.

### Obtaining OA’s Approval To Sell Or Buy A HDB Flat

Property of an HDB flat will not vest with the OA in the event that the
bankrupt flat owner is a Singapore citizen, or when a co-owner of the
flat is a Singapore citizen.

**Application to sell a HDB flat**

**Obtaining OA Approval:** The OA’s approval is required for all
applications to sell HDB flats when property of the HDB flat vests with
the OA. However, a bankrupt who wishes to use all or part of the
proceeds from the sale of his or her HDB flat to pay his creditors may
do so. The OA’s Practice Circular No. 1 of 2009 encourages bankrupts
that wish to do so to contact their case officer within 2 weeks after
their 1st appointment with the HDB so that the OA may assist the
bankrupt in offering a debt settlement proposal to creditors.

The OA’s Practice Circular No. 1 of 2009 sets out the requirements for
the sale of immovable property that vests in the OA The permission of
the OA is required before entering into an agreement for selling the
property. The OA will generally not object if the bankrupt is going to
sell his flat at or above the valuation price as the proceeds of sale
will help get him out of bankruptcy. The OA will assist him to obtain a
discharge after the HDB has remitted the sale proceeds for the OA's
administration. Any share of insolvent’s cash from purchasers as
deposit/option fee should be forwarded to the OA as well. If part of the
net sale proceeds is needed to buy another flat, this should be
specified when submitting an application to the OA.

**Procedures involved in selling a HDB flat**

In order to process the application, the insolvent must submit the
following:

-   All information relating to the proposed sale.
-   Option to Purchase document.
-   Valuation Report (not older than 3 months).
-   Copy of the title searches at the Singapore Land Authority.
-   Latest CPF statements of the property owners.
-   Latest statement of accounts from mortgagee bank (if any) and the
    mortgagee bank’s written statement of consent to the sale.

    > Additional documents (such as the Transmission Application on
    > Bankruptcy of Proprietor and the Transfer document) must be
    > submitted within 10 working days of completion of the sale.

**Buying an HDB flat**

The OA has no objection to the insolvent buying an HDB flat but he
should not be seen to be maintaining an ostentatious lifestyle while
debts remain unpaid. A bankrupt will therefore, generally, not be
allowed to purchase a HDB Executive/Maisonette flat. For purchase of a
HDB Executive/Maisonette flat, he must show that he has both the means
and the need for such a flat. His conduct and co-operation will also be
considered when assessing such applications.

**Procedures involved in buying a HDB flat**

In order to process an application to purchase an HDB flat, the
insolvent is required to submit the following documents to the OA:

a\. Application To The OA To Buy A HDB Executive/Maisonette Flat
(application forms for the purchase of an executive flat or maisonette
are available online) [^2], **and**

b.  Latest CPF statement of the applicant and co-applicant.

### Applications By Insolvents To Manage A Business Or Act As Director

**Principle:** It is important that an insolvent remains economically
productive even during insolvency as this will allow him to settle his
debts earlier and be discharged from bankruptcy quickly. It will also
allow the insolvent to continue contributing economically to society. It
is for these reasons that the law has been amended to make it easier for
an undischarged insolvent to engage in business or trade, take part in
the management or act as director of a company or business, especially
if he is experienced in business.

An undischarged insolvent may apply to the High Court or to the OA for
permission to take part in or to be concerned in the management of any
business or company or to act as a Director of a company. Please note
that it is an offence punishable with imprisonment of up to 2 years, a
fine not exceeding S\$10,000, or both, for an undischarged bankrupt to
directly or indirectly take part in or to be concerned in the management
of any business or company or to act as Director of a company without
the leave of the High Court or the written permission of the OA, under
Section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act (Cap 32) and Section
148(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50).

**1. Applying for the OA’s permission**

The OA’s permission must be sought in order to:

1\. Directly or indirectly take part in or be concerned with the
management of any business carried on by a person required to be
registered under the Business Registration Act (Cap 32); **or**

2\. To act as director or directly or indirectly take part in or be
concerned with the management of any corporation (Singapore or foreign
company) under the Companies Act (Cap 50).

**2. Relevant Forms Required**

An application for the OA's written permission should be made using
either **Form B-ARC-B** (for managing a business under the Business
Registration Act (Cap 32)) or **Form B-ARC-C** (for acting as director
or managing a company pursuant to the Companies Act (Cap 50)). Both
forms may be accessed via the IPTO website [^3].

The relevant form must be submitted with the documents indicated,
including, amongst others:

-   People’s Profile Printout of the insolvent from the Accounting &
    Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”).
-   Company or business Profile Printout from ACRA.
-   Latest audited accounts or financial statements of the company or
    business; **and**
-   Letter from the other director(s) or partner(s) and the sponsor
    indicating they are aware of the bankruptcy order and have **no
    objections** to the bankrupt being a director and/or managing the
    company or business.

**3. Processing of the application**

The undischarged insolvent’s application will first be assessed by an
**Application Review Committee (ARC)** comprising of Legal Officers,
Senior Insolvency Officers and Accountants.

It will be processed within 2 weeks of the submission of all relevant
documents and information for insolvents categorised in the Green Zone.

Each application will be considered on its own merits. In deciding
whether or not to grant the application, the OA will take into
consideration a number of factors including:

-   Cause of the individual’s insolvency.
-   The insolvent’s conduct before and during insolvency.
-   The insolvent’s previous involvement in business or company.
-   The nature and the viability of the proposed business or company.
-   The nature of insolvent’s involvement in the business or company.
-   Benefits to creditors from the insolvent’s involvement in the
    business or company.
-   The risk of the insolvent incurring more debts as a result of
    management activities.

As provided by law, the OA may refuse or approve the application subject
to conditions such as he may impose. Such conditions may include
maintaining proper accounting records, making regular payments to the
bankruptcy estate from income or profits of the business or company for
the benefit of creditors.

The applicant should contact their Case Management Officer for further
information.

## Commonly Asked Questions on Bankruptcy

### GENERAL ENQUIRIES

**What is ‘declaring’ Bankruptcy?**

To be declared bankrupt means that the High Court has issued a
bankruptcy order officially pronouncing the debtor to be in bankruptcy.
As of the date of the bankruptcy order, and until discharge or annulment
of the same, the insolvent will be subject to all the limitations and
restrictions prescribed in the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20).

**Can I declare myself bankrupt before the court does? Does it matter?**

A debtor may file an application for bankruptcy, but the declaration
itself will only be issued by the High Court in the form of a bankruptcy
order. Therefore, you cannot declare bankruptcy before the court
declares you bankrupt – you can only apply to have yourself recognised
as bankrupt before someone else does.

Whether you apply or someone else applies for you will have no impact on
the court’s decision to declare you bankrupt.

**What are my legal options?**

Upon receiving a statutory demand for payment by one of his creditors, a
debtor may contact the creditor or his counsel to reach an agreement and
discontinue the bankruptcy proceedings.

Alternatively, the debtor may seek to set aside the demand if he or she:

-   Has a valid counterclaim equivalent to or exceeding the amount of
    the debt stated demand.
-   Disputes the debt.
-   Has assets which the creditor holds or has a security over in
    respect of the debt, which has not been taken into account in
    the demand.
-   Has received a statutory demand which is defective in its form
    and contents.

**How can I avoid Bankruptcy?**

A debtor who has been served with a statutory demand may and should
attempt to reach an arrangement with the creditor(s) and avoid
bankruptcy proceedings. If unable to do so, a Debt Repayment Scheme
under the OA’s supervision is an alternative option.

Debtors may seek assistance from Credit Counselling Singapore at the
following:

*Credit Counselling Singapore*

General line: 6225 5227 | Fax: 6338 6586

Email: <enquiry@ccs.org.sg>

Website: <http://www.ccs.org.sg>

Debtors on a Debt Repayment Scheme may also take advantage of a
subsidized Financial Education Workshop held by the IPTO aimed at
providing bankrupts or debtors on a Debt Repayment Scheme with necessary
money management tools.

Those interested should contact IPTO via e-mail [^4].

**What will I lose if I am declared Bankrupt?**

If declared bankrupt, a debtors assets will vest in the OA, who shall be
charged with realising the assets for the purposes of making dividend
payments to the creditors. Assets that will vest in the OA include
anything of value save for necessary furniture and household items and
limited tools of trade, and those assets protected by law (such as HDB
flats when the owner or co-owner is a Singaporean citizen). In the event
that the bankrupt is employed, a portion of his or her salary must be
contributed to the bankruptcy estate.

Further, a bankrupt may also be forced to endure additional
restrictions, such as the inability to travel. (Please refer to previous
Section 1.2.4 for further information.)

**Can I claim money from a Bankrupt person?**

Not directly. Bankrupts that receive a claim for payment from a creditor
while in bankruptcy are advised to forward such claims to the OA. The OA
will then decide whether you are able to claim the money.

**Can I still execute the Writ of Summons against my debtor after he is
made a bankrupt?**

No.

Since they have been made a bankrupt, all their affairs would be
administered by the OA What you can do is file a proof of debt against
them.

### PROCEDURAL ENQUIRIES

**I have been served with a Statutory Demand, what should I do next?**

You may wish to contact the creditor or the creditor's counsel and try
to arrange for an instalment payment scheme or to make voluntary
arrangements to settle your debt and ask the creditor not to carry on
with bankruptcy proceedings.

Alternatively, you may wish to take out an application to court to set
aside the statutory demand if:

a.  You have a valid counterclaim equivalent to or exceeding the amount
    of the debt stated in the statutory demand.
b.  You dispute the debt.
c.  The creditor holds your assets or security in respect of the debt,
    which has not been taken into account in the statutory demand.
d.  The statutory demand is defective in its form and contents.

**How do I set aside a Statutory Demand served on me?**

**1. Filing an Originating Summons:** The procedure for setting aside a
statutory demand is to apply to court by filing an Originating Summons
(Bankruptcy - To Set Aside Statutory Demand) with an Affidavit
(Bankruptcy) within 14 days (or 21 days where the demand is served
outside jurisdiction) from the date the statutory demand was served on
you.

**2. Serving the Originating Summons:** After filing these documents,
you must serve the Originating Summons together with the supporting
affidavit on the creditor within 3 days of your court application. You
may also apply for more time from the court, which may decide the
application or adjourn it, giving such directions as it thinks
appropriate. In the event that the application to set aside the
statutory demand is dismissed by the court, the creditor may proceed
with bankruptcy proceedings.

**When will the hearing of the application to set aside the statutory
demand be fixed?**

The hearing will usually be fixed **within two weeks** from the date the
application is filed.

**What is the difference between a debtor's bankruptcy application and a
creditor's bankruptcy application?**

A debtor's application is filed when the debtor applies to make
himself/herself a bankrupt. Alternatively, a creditor who is owed
**S\$10,000** or more by a debtor can apply to court to bankrupt the
debtor. In both situations, a bankruptcy order will be made by the court
against the debtor if the application succeeds.

**How do I self-petition for bankruptcy?**

The OA does not provide advice on the procedures for filing a
self-petition. The procedure for a debtor’s bankruptcy application is
covered in Sections 134 – 146 of the Bankruptcy Rules.

A step-by-step explanation can also be viewed online [^5].

In order to file a bankruptcy application, debtor must complete the
following documents:

a.  Originating Summons (Debtor’s Bankruptcy Application)
b.  Supporting Affidavit (Bankruptcy)
c.  Affidavit Verifying the Statement of Affairs
d.  Statement of Affairs
e.  Supporting Affidavit \[Bankruptcy – Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS)
    applies or DRS does not apply (see Section E of the Supreme Court
    Guide on Bankruptcy Proceedings in the High Court, see link above),
    whichever Affidavit is applicable\]

If you require assistance in completing the Statement of Affairs, you
may bring your bank statements and other relevant documents to the IPTO
for assistance upon payment of the prescribed fee.

The Supporting Affidavit (Bankruptcy) and Affidavit Verifying the
Statement of Affairs must be sworn to (or affirmed) before a
Commissioner for Oaths. Once you have prepared your documents, you will
have to go to the IPTO and make payment with the OA of the
administrative fee. The IPTO will issue you with a temporary receipt.

The temporary receipt and remaining documents must be brought to the
Supreme Court Insolvency Counter. You should proceed to the Cashier's
Counter to make a payment for stamp fees/Commissioner for Oaths fees.
You must then swear or affirm the affidavit verifying the Statement of
Affairs and the Supporting Affidavit (Bankruptcy) before a Commissioner
for Oaths.

Next, you should go to the LawNet Service Bureau, located at Level 1 of
the Supreme Court, to file your documents upon payment of the prescribed
fee. The LawNet Service Bureau will inform you when to return to collect
your documents. Upon collection of the documents, the date and time that
your application will be heard in court will be printed on your
application. The debtor must attend the hearing at the appointed date
and time. If you are unable to attend the hearing on the assigned date,
you must write to the Registrar of the Supreme Court immediately to
request a later hearing date and state the reasons for your request.

Please be advised not to consider self-petition as an option to relieve
your financial problems. You may wish to seek assistance from Credit
Counselling Singapore for a discussion on how you can reach an amicable
settlement with your creditors without resorting to bankruptcy.

In any event, if you require any assistance from the Official Assignee's
Pre-Bankruptcy Advisory & Mediation Services, please contact:

Tel: [6325-1465](tel:+6563251465)

**Can I submit a hand written application?**

The documents referred to in the above question must be typewritten
except for the Statement of Affairs, which may be hand written.

**What will happen if I don't submit the Income and Expenditure (I&E)
Statement?**

It is an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding
two years or to fine not exceeding S\$10,000 or both if you fail to
submit the I&E Statement.

**What actions can a bank take against me?**

Financial institutions such as banks that hold security over the assets
or goods of a bankrupt have a right to sell these if you default on your
payments.

The terms of financial products such as bank accounts and loans will be
governed by an agreement between the bank and its customers. Typically,
such agreements will permit the bank to freeze or terminate a debtor’s
bank accounts.

**How does a creditor file a claim against a bankrupt?**

Once a debtor has been declared bankrupt by the Court, his creditors can
no longer initiate or continue with any legal action to recover monetary
claims that arose prior to his/ her insolvency.

Instead, they can submit a **Proof of Debt (Form 23)** to the OA, giving
a detailed account of their claims against the bankrupt. Debts that have
been incurred after the Bankruptcy Order has been made are not
"provable" (i.e. not claimable) against the bankrupt's estate. If the
bankrupt disputes the sum claimed, the creditor(s) will be asked to
provide documentary evidence supporting their claims.

**What will happen if I do not attend the bankruptcy hearing?**

If you have filed a debtor's application and do not attend the
bankruptcy hearing, the application may be adjourned to a later hearing
date or dismissed by the court. If the application is dismissed and you
still wish to have yourself made bankrupt, you will have to re-apply and
pay a fresh set of filing and administrative fees.

If a creditor has applied to make you bankrupt and you do not attend the
hearing, a bankruptcy order may be made against you, unless the creditor
asks the court for the application to be heard at a later date instead.

**A bankruptcy order has been made against me. I was not aware of the
bankruptcy** **proceedings against me. How do I set the bankruptcy order
aside?**

To set aside the Bankruptcy Order, two documents are required for filing
in court:

a.  Summons (Bankruptcy); and
b.  Affidavit (Bankruptcy)

The Affidavit (Bankruptcy) is required to be sworn or affirmed before a
Commissioner for Oaths before it can be filed. You can obtain sample
documents of the Summons (Bankruptcy) and the Affidavit (Bankruptcy) at
the Insolvency Counter of the Supreme Court which is located at the
Legal Registry, Supreme Court (Level 2).

The two documents are to be filed at the LawNet Service Bureau located
at Level 1 of the Supreme Court. After filing, you have to serve the
documents on your creditor and the Official Assignee. At the hearing,
the court will determine the merits of your application to set aside the
bankruptcy order.

**How do I appeal against the bankruptcy order?**

Three documents are required for filing:

1.  Registrar's Appeal - to be filed within 14 days from the date of the
bankruptcy order at the Trials Counter of the Supreme Court's Legal Registry;

2.  Summons (Bankruptcy) for Stay of Proceeding - to be filed at the Insolvency Counter; **and**

3.  Affidavit (Bankruptcy)

A sample document of the Registrar's Appeal form can be obtained at the
Trials Counter and a copy of the Summons (Bankruptcy) and the Affidavit
(Bankruptcy) can be obtained at the Insolvency Counter. Both counters
are located at the Legal Registry, Supreme Court (Level 2).

The Affidavit (Bankruptcy) is required to be affirmed before a
Commissioner for Oaths before the affidavit can be filed. All three
documents are to be filed at the LawNet Service Bureau. After the
documents are filed, you have to serve the documents on your creditor
and the Official Assignee. At the hearing, the court will determine the
merits of your application.

### ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO BANKRUPTCY

**I have been served with a creditor's bankruptcy application, how can I
resist my creditor's attempt to make me a bankrupt?**

You may approach your creditor's solicitor to negotiate a mutually
satisfactory settlement proposal which may persuade your creditor to
withdraw his application for a bankruptcy order against you.

Alternatively, if you have valid reasons to set aside the bankruptcy
application, you can object to the application by filing a Notice of
Objection at least 3 days before the bankruptcy application is heard,
specifying your reasons for objecting to the bankruptcy application. If
you choose to pursue this course of action, please take note that you
will need to serve a copy of the filed Notice of Objection on your
creditor and the Official Assignee.

**I have made an alternative proposal for payment to my creditor but I
have not** **heard from my creditor or their lawyers. Do I need to
attend the bankruptcy hearing?**

Yes. You should attend the hearing and inform the court that you tried
to contact your creditor but did not receive any response. At the
hearing, your creditor's lawyers will inform the court whether they
agree with your proposal. If they agree, they may either apply for an
adjournment to monitor your payments, or ask for leave to withdraw the
Originating Summons against you. If they are not agreeable, the court
may adjourn the hearing to give you more time to make a better proposal,
or the court may make the bankruptcy order against you.

**I have made an alternative proposal for payment to my creditor but the
proposal** **has been rejected. Do I need to attend the bankruptcy
hearing?**

Yes. You should attend the hearing and inform the court that you had
made a repayment proposal to your creditor but the proposal was not
agreeable to your creditor. The court may adjourn the hearing to give
you more time to make a better proposal, or the court may make the
bankruptcy order against you.

### SPOUSAL AND FAMILY CONCERNS

**If my spouse is the guarantor of my debt, should he/she apply for
bankruptcy as well?**

It would depend on your spouse's financial situation and whether he/she
is in fact able to fulfil his/her obligations as a guarantor. The Court
will not grant a bankruptcy order upon a debtor's application unless it
is satisfied that the debtor is unable to pay his/her debts. Your
creditor may also decide to institute bankruptcy proceedings against
your spouse if he/she is unable to repay your debt.

**Will divorce save me from my spouse's creditors?**

The only advantage of getting a divorce would be to determine the amount
of matrimonial assets your spouse is entitled to. The matrimonial home
is one of the assets capable of division by the court. If you are both
already maintaining separate bank accounts and assets, there is no
advantage in a divorce unless there are joint assets of which you wish
to carve out your share before the creditors get to the assets.

If you get a divorce, creditors will not come after you if the debts are
solely his/hers (unless you acted as guarantor). For example, for credit
cards and accounts that are solely in his/her name - the banks in that
case can only look to him/her to settle, not you. They can come after
you only if you were his/her guarantor, or if the account is a joint
one. A bank may deduct the money from the joint account to satisfy part,
or all, of the debts and you are advised not to leave your savings in
that account.

If it is a credit line, overdraft facility or credit card account, then
both of you are jointly and individually liable for the credit spent.

You should withdraw your name from the account, if the bank allows you
to do so. Both of you could instruct the bank to immediately freeze any
line of credit on the account so your spouse cannot incur further debts
on it.

You then need to pay the minimum instalments on time or the bank may
take action over the account. You could pay off the debt in full and
close the account to stop further action against you. This will leave
only your spouse's individual bank accounts, which only he/she is liable
for.

You and your spouse should inform the HDB branch office about your
financial problems so HDB will not take legal action against you for any
HDB arrears. A revised payment plan for reduced instalments for a
limited period can be worked out. You can later revert to the current
arrangement.

However, a divorce will not protect you against your spouse’s debts
unless they are debts incurred for the family, and the court issues an
order that specifically states that you will not be responsible for
them. The court grants such orders only if the debt is already in the
sole name of the spouse - for example, if he/she took out a renovation
or study loan. The order will state that one party is solely responsible
for the repayment of the debt.

**How do I protect my assets if my spouse is declared bankrupt?**

The best way to protect your assets is to keep them strictly separate,
e.g. not to have any joint credit cards, bank accounts, properties or
fixed deposits. Your spouse’s creditors can only go after the money held
in the name of your spouse, whether it is solely held by him/her or
jointly with any other person. They cannot touch the money in your sole
accounts or in your joint accounts with your children unless you or your
children have acted as guarantors for your spouse’s debts or are
co-borrowers.

**Joint-tenancy:** If you and your spouse are joint tenants of your
home, you can change the ownership into tenants-in-common and you can
deal with your own share in any way you want. However the process of
changing from joint tenants to tenants in common will result in both
parties receiving equal shares regardless of original contributions to
the purchase price

**Non-essential home items:** Your spouse’s creditors can also enforce
payment by a writ of seizure and sale against the non-essential items in
your home, such as computers and TVs. If you can prove with receipts or
credit card or bank statements that you alone paid for them, the
creditors will be prevented from auctioning off the items.

**Will my family be liable for my debts? For example, will a child be
liable to the debts of his father?**

Creditors may make the family members of a bankrupt liable for the debts
owed only if the family members are co-borrowers on a mortgage loan, an
unsecured line of credit or under a hire-purchase agreement. Family
members may also be made liable if they acted as guarantors for the
bankrupt’s debts.

**Are there any other people who may be affected by my debt?**

Yes. Some examples include:

-   Co-applicants for future loans may be adversely affected by
    your bankruptcy.
-   Co-owners of property with the bankrupt as the property could be
    sold off.
-   Parties who have entered into a contract jointly with the person
    declared bankrupt.

### STATUS / HANDLING OF ASSETS UPON BANKRUPTCY

**Can a co-owned flat and/or furniture be seized?**

Yes.

Furniture and household items that are not deemed indispensable for
satisfying his needs or those of his family may be seized. Similarly,
co-owned properties or flats will also vest in the OA unless the flat is
an HDB where one of the co-owners is a Singaporean citizen.

**Will any proceeds from a sale of property go to the bankrupt? Or their
CPF?**

After payment in full has been made to a bankrupt’s creditors, the
bankrupt shall be entitled to any surplus pursuant to section 122 of the
Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20). It should be noted that proceeds from the
sale of investments made (prior to bankruptcy) using CPF monies will be
credited into bankrupt’s CPF Investment Account or Special Account.

**What about insurance policies of the insolvent person?**

If the nominated beneficiaries such as spouse and/or children in his
insurance policies from the onset, an irrevocable statutory trust under
section 73 Conveyancing and Law of Property Act is created. When such
trust is formed, the proceeds from the policy will avoid probate process
in the case of death of the insured. Such S73 policies are also
protected against creditors. Thus, in the event of bankruptcy, creditors
cannot seize them. One point to note is that such S73 policies cannot be
purchased using CPF funds, as S73 policies was designed to protect the
family whilst CPF funds are meant for retirement. Note that named
beneficiaries cannot be changed without the consent of the
beneficiaries.

**Are CPF monies protected from distribution among the bankrupt's
creditors?**

The funds in a person's CPF account cannot be seized, attached, or
levied upon by his creditors to satisfy any debt or claim and such funds
do not vest in the OA upon bankruptcy.

Undischarged bankrupts who have attained the age of 55 are restricted
from withdrawing monies from their CPF accounts despite ordinarily being
entitled to draw from these funds. Any withdrawals from CPF monies made
by undischarged bankrupts are subject to the CPF Board's discretion:
Section 27, Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36).

**What should I do if there is a pending Court Action?**

You should immediately write in to the OA office and seek their
permission to continue the Court Action. You should provide the facts of
the case and details as to who is bearing all the legal costs.

**Can creditors seize property located overseas? What about theOA?**

Yes. The OA may institute any action or legal proceedings relating to
the property of the bankrupt, which could include proceedings for
seizing debtor’s assets abroad. However, this will generally depend on
the enforceability of foreign judgments under the law of the country
where the assets are located. In particular, Sections 151 and 152 of the
Bankruptcy Act provide for close cooperation and mutual recognition for
the bankruptcy courts and OAs of Singapore and Malaysia (and other
“designated countries”).

**Can I trade in shares?**

A bankrupt is allowed to sell previously owned shares but he is not
permitted to purchase any new shares. Public listed and shares of
Private Limited companies will be sold by the Official Assignee.

**A bankrupt borrows from me without informing that they are an
undischarged bankrupt. What can I do?**

Write to the OA office with regards to the matter for their
investigation.

### ENQUIRIES RELATING TO TRAVEL

**Is an undischarged bankrupt allowed to leave Singapore to start afresh
overseas?**

No.

Under Section 131(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20) an
undischarged bankrupt cannot leave the country or remain or reside
outside the country without first obtaining the permission of the OA.
Contravention of this Section attracts either a maximum fine of
S\$10,000.00, or a maximum imprisonment of 2 years, or both.

Powers are also given to the OA under Section 116(4) to impound the
bankrupt's passport if he thinks fit and to direct the Controller of
Immigration to take measures to prevent the bankrupt from leaving the
country, such as retaining the bankrupt's passport, certificate of
identity, or any travel documents authorising the bankrupt to leave or
enter Singapore.

**What if I have to travel frequently?**

If you have to travel frequently, you may apply for block leave for
either 3 months or 6 months. During this period, you can travel as many
times as you wish. For all travel applications, you have to submit via
the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office website (www.ipto.gov.sg) for
their consideration.

### DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEME

**What is Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS)?**

The Bankruptcy Act was amended to provide for the Debt Repayment Scheme.
The new provisions are applicable to all bankruptcy applications filed
on or after 18 May 2009. The objective of the DRS is to assist debtors
who have debts less than \$100,000 to pay their debts by way of a debt
repayment plan over a fixed period of time. This seeks to give creditors
their rights and debtors an opportunity for a fresh start in their
financial matters.

After a bankruptcy application has been made and where the Court
considers that on the face of the application, the following criteria
has been satisfied, the Court will adjourn the application for the
Official Assignee to assess if the debtor is suitable for the DRS:

a.  The debts do not exceed \$100,000.
b.  The debtor is not an undischarged bankrupt and has not been a
    bankrupt within the past 5 years.
c.  A voluntary arrangement in respect of the debtor is not in effect,
    and was not in effect within the past 5 years.
d.  The debtor is not subject to any debt repayment scheme, and has not
    been subject to any such scheme within the past 5 years.
e.  The debtor is not a sole proprietor, a partner of a firm or a
    partner in a limited liability partnership.

If the debtor is assessed to be suitable for the DRS, a debt repayment
plan may commence. Upon commencement of this plan, the adjourned
bankruptcy application is deemed withdrawn. If the debtor is found to be
unsuitable for the DRS, the court will proceed to hear the bankruptcy
application and may order that the debtor be made a bankrupt.

**Can I apply for the DRS without filing a Debtor's** **Bankruptcy
Application with the High Court?**

No. You must first file a Debtor's Bankruptcy Application. If the Court
is satisfied on the face of your application that you qualify for the
DRS, your case will then be adjourned for the Official Assignee to
assess your suitability.

**How do I complete paragraph 1 of the Affidavit in Support of
Debtor’s** **Bankruptcy Application?**

You have to state which of the relevant limbs below is applicable to
you:

a.  That you are domiciled in Singapore;
b.  That you have property in Singapore; **or**
c.  That you have, at any time any time within the period of one year
    immediately before the date of your application

    > \(i) been ordinarily resident or have had a place of residence in
    > Singapore; **or**
    >
    > (ii) carried on business in Singapore.

**I wish to apply for the DRS. How do I complete paragraph 4 of the
Affidavit in Support of Debtor’s Bankruptcy Application?**

You should be completing the Supporting Affidavit (DRS applies). YOU
MUST SATISFY ALL LIMBS IN PARAGRAPH 4(a) TO (i) OF THE SAID AFFIDAVIT.
If you do not satisfy any one limb in paragraph 4(a) to (i), then you
will not be considered for the DRS. In such a situation, you should be
completing Supporting Affidavit (DRS does not apply) (see link provided
on the next page).

**If DRS does not apply to me, how should I complete** **paragraph 4 of
the Affidavit in Support of Debtor’s Bankruptcy Application?**

You should be completing the Supporting Affidavit (DRS does not apply)
(see link provided on the next page). For paragraph 4, you should decide
which of the limbs in paragraph 4(a) to (i) are applicable to you and
delete the rest that are not applicable.

**Can I file the old form of the Affidavit in Support of Debtor’s
Bankruptcy Application if my application is made after 18 May 2009?**

No, the old form is no longer valid. If you choose to file a Debtor’s
Bankruptcy Application using the old form of Supporting Affidavit, the
Court may reject your application upon filing or, alternatively, the
Court may accept the application but require that you file the new form
of Supporting Affidavit.

**Where can I download the forms to apply for an order of bankruptcy
against myself and to apply for the DRS?**

The following forms can be downloaded from the Supreme Court website:

**What if a debtor entered into a hire-purchase agreement before the
bankruptcy application was made against him or has an existing mortgage
loan on his home?**

If a debtor entered into a hire-purchase agreement before the bankruptcy
application was made against him or has an existing mortgage loan on a
property, he must inform the OA of this when he is being considered for
the Scheme. He should continue to make payments to the hire-purchase
company or the bank in accordance with the terms of the hire-purchase
agreement or the mortgage, as the case may be.

**How will the monthly payments made by the debtor in accordance with
the Plan be distributed to the creditors?**

Upon commencement of the plan, creditors will receive periodic payments.
These will continue until the completion of the payments as set out in
the terms of the plan as approved by a majority (in numbers) of the
creditors representing at least ¾ of the debtor’s debts.

**Can creditors still take action against the debtor after the
commencement of the Plan for debts owed to them?**

Creditors whose debts were incurred prior to the commencement of the
plan should file a proof of debt with the OA, notwithstanding that the
plan has commenced.

**When will a debtor know if he qualifies and is found suitable for the
Scheme?**

When a debtor is referred by the Court to IPTO, the hearing of the
bankruptcy application will be adjourned for a period of up to 6 months
to enable the OA to assess his suitability for the Scheme. The OA will
inform the Court, the debtor and the applicant-creditor of the outcome
of the assessment before the end of the period of adjournment.

**What happens once a debtor is referred by the Court to the OA?**

The debtor will receive a notice from the OA informing him of the
appointment of his administrator who will assess his suitability for the
Scheme. The debtor will also receive a set of documents which he is
required to complete. The debtor will be required to attend at IPTO on
the date stated in the notice to submit the completed documents.

**Can a debtor be found to be unsuitable for DRS?**

Yes, a debtor can be found to be unsuitable for DRS if:

-   He does not cooperate with the OA (e.g. if debtor fails to submit or
    complete the documents required of him.
-   He is unemployed at the time the assessment is being made by the OA.
-   He is presently an undischarged bankrupt/ has been in bankruptcy
    sometime in the past 5 years.
-   He is presently or has been under a Voluntary Arrangement for the
    past 5 years.
-   He is a sole-proprietor/ business owner/ partner of a firm .
-   His unsecured debts exceed S\$100,000.

The Court, the debtor and the applicant-creditor will be informed of his
unsuitability and the adjourned bankruptcy proceedings will then resume.

**Does the debtor have to be present at the first meeting with his
creditors?**

Yes, the debtor must be present at the first meeting of his creditors.
The debtor may be considered unsuitable for the Scheme if he fails to
attend the meeting without a valid reason and without having obtained
the permission of the OA to be absent. If the debtor is unable to attend
the meeting the OA should be informed at least 3 days prior to the
meeting of creditors.

**Where can a debtor make his repayments?**

The debtor can make his repayments at any SingPost branch, SAM machine
or pay directly at the URA Centre’s cashier (located at 45 Maxwell Road
URA Centre East Wing, #06-11, Singapore 069118).

**Who will monitor repayments made by the debtor?**

The OA will monitor the repayments made by the debtor.

**What is a debtor’s minimum repayment amount?**

There is no fixed minimum amount. The minimum repayment amount is
determined on a case by case basis taking into account the particular
debtor’s circumstances, income and expenses.

**What if the debtor’s personal circumstances change after the
commencement of the payment plan?**

The debtor must inform the OA of any change in his personal
circumstances, particularly where the change may affect his ability to
comply with the terms of the Plan. The OA may then consider modifying
the Plan.

**What if the debtor is unhappy with the Plan or any modifications
made?**

A debtor who is unhappy with the Plan or any modification made to it may
file an appeal with the Appeal Panel using the appropriate Form found
online [^6].

The notice of appeal must be filed no later than 14 days as of the OA’s
notice of the approved Scheme.

**If a debtor is unable to or fails to comply with the terms of the Plan
or to fulfill the obligations imposed on him by law, can he be declared
a bankrupt?**

If a debtor is unable to or fails to comply with the terms of the Plan
or if he fails to fulfill the obligations imposed on him by law, the OA
may issue a Certificate of Failure against him. His creditors can then
proceed to initiate fresh bankruptcy proceedings, and he may be declared
a bankrupt by the Court.

**How will a creditor know if a debtor is under a DRS?**

A creditor who has been disclosed as a creditor by the debtor will
receive a notice from the OA to file a proof of debt against the debtor.
A creditor may also conduct a search at a fee of S$6 via
www.isis.gov.sg on an individual to check if an individual is on the
Scheme.

**How does a creditor file a claim against a debtor?**

Creditors can file their proof of debt electronically online [^7] for a
prescribed fee of S$5. Alternatively, creditors may download the Proof
of Debt form online [^8] and submit it manually to The Insolvency and
Public Trustee’s Office, 45 Maxwell Road, #07-11, The URA Centre (East
Wing), Singapore 069118 for a prescribed fee of S$8.

**Does a creditor need to attend the first meeting with the debtor?**

A creditor may choose not to attend the meeting. However, if the
creditor wishes to raise questions in relation to the debtor’s Statement
of Affairs, Income and Expenditure Statement and the Plan, he is
required to submit his list of questions to the OA at least 7 days
before the meeting. The OA will examine the questions to determine if
they are relevant. The OA will disallow questions which are irrelevant,
scandalous, frivolous or vexatious. A creditor must bring all documents
in support of his claim of a debt against the debtor. Where a creditor
has yet to submit his proof of debt, he must also bring a copy of the
proof of debt

**What happens if a creditor discovers any changes to the debtor’s
personal** **circumstances after the commencement of the Plan?**

The creditor must inform the OA and the OA may make modifications to the
Plan.

**Will a creditor be notified if the circumstances of the debtor should
change during the repayment period?**

A creditor will be informed of any changes in the debtor’s circumstances
that may affect the debtor’s ability to fulfill the terms of the Plan.

**What happens if a creditor disagrees with the Plan?**

The creditor may file an appeal with the Appeal Panel using the
appropriate Form found online [^9]. The notice of appeal must be filed
no later than 14 days as of the OA’s notice of the approved Scheme.

**Will the execution of a writ of seizure and sale be stopped if I file
for bankruptcy** **application?**

No, the execution will not be stopped.

**Can I appeal against a writ of seizure and sale?**

If a bankrupt receives a writ of seizure and sale he should immediately
contact the OA. Under Section 131(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20)
a bankrupt may not, without the permission of the OA, maintain any legal
proceedings other than an action for damages in respect of an injury to
his person.

**Should I inform all my creditors about my Debtor’s Bankruptcy
Application?**

That is a choice you have to make. There is no requirement in law for
you to do so.

**What do I do if the bank has frozen my account pending the outcome of
my bankruptcy application?**

You should approach your bank for clarification on why they have done
that. You may also wish to clarify whether you have (in the past) agreed
that they may take such measures if a bankruptcy application is
commenced against you.

**Am I able to negotiate with my bank in relation to bankruptcy?**

Yes. You may enter into a private arrangement with your creditor bank
to:

-   Pay debts by instalments
-   Reschedule repayments
-   Get an extension of time to liquidate assets, **or**
-   Seek other financial sources to repay the debts

**Disclosure requirements:** You should inform the bank truthfully and completely of
your latest financial position. You should provide information and documentary evidence
readily to prove your current financial position. You should not make empty promises
after entering into alternative repayment arrangements, and you must make serious
efforts to keep to the new repayment arrangements.

Debtors may also apply to court for an interim order for a voluntary
arrangement, which is a negotiated debt settlement under
Part V of the Bankruptcy Act. The debtor
must disclose his assets and liabilities, and make a proposal on how he
intends to settle his debts with various creditors. If the proposal is
accepted by creditors and implemented successfully, it would benefit the
debtor and his creditors. [^10]

### LOAN RECOVERY

**How do I recover a personal loan in the event of bankruptcy?**

If the loan was made prior to the bankruptcy order, then the creditor is
required to file a Proof of Debt with the OA.

**How do I recover a loan if the person is dead?**

Even death does not wipe out debts. Settlement of debts has first
priority over estate distribution. It is only when all estate debts have
been settled, or in rare occasion been forgiven, that the residual
estate can be distributed amongst beneficiaries.

As a creditor, you may lodge a caveat on the estate, until all creditors
are satisfied that there are sufficient funds in the estate and an
undertaking from the estate legal representative to settle the debt
before distribution is present. Before the caveat is removed, the letter
of administration or grant of probate will not be issued.

You must keep in mind though, that if there is no formal IOU, it would
be very difficult for you to recover from the estate. The estate legal
representative is under no legal obligation to recognise such loans, let
alone settle it. However, if there is admissible evidence, like a
bounced cheque issued by the debtor shortly before he dies, you can file
a caveat onto the estate. [^11]

**Are there expiry dates for debts?**

Debts that are incurred after the date of the making of the Bankruptcy
Order are not provable (claimable) against the bankruptcy estate.

**How do I negotiate an instalment plan?**

Debtors should inform the bank truthfully and completely of
your latest financial position. They should provide information and documentary evidence
readily to prove your current financial position. Debtors should not make empty promises
after entering into alternative repayment arrangements, and must make serious
efforts to keep to the new repayment arrangements.

Debtors may also apply to court for an interim order for a voluntary
arrangement, which is a negotiated debt settlement under
Part V of the Bankruptcy) Act. The debtor
must disclose his assets and liabilities, and make a proposal on how he
intends to settle his debts with various creditors. If the proposal is
accepted by creditors and implemented successfully, it would benefit the
debtor and his creditors. [^12]

### GUARANTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

**What are my rights and responsibilities as a guarantor/surety in the
event of default by the principal debtor?**

The rights of the parties would usually depend on the terms of the
particular guarantee document. A surety´s liability, being collateral to
that of the principal debtor, arises when there has been a **default**
by the principal debtor. The liability arises immediately upon the
default and, **unless the guarantee provides otherwise**, is not
conditional upon the creditor doing any of the following:

-   Notifying the surety of the principal debtor´s default
-   Making a demand upon the surety
-   Suing the principal debtor **or**
-   Realising any security held by the creditor

Thus, a surety who wishes to make his liability so conditional must make
specific provision in the document of guarantee.

Since collateral liability is an essential aspect of a guarantee, and if
the principal debtor is discharged, so is the surety. Thus, if the
principal debtor performs his primary obligation and makes payment, the
surety is also discharged. Another situation where the principal debtor
is discharged is where the creditor´s breach of contract entitles the
principal debtor to terminate the principal contract.

There are many scenarios in which the *conduct of the creditor may
result in the discharge of the surety*:

-   **Variation of Principal Contract: “**Any variation to the principal
    contract, other than variations which are beneficial or which cannot
    be prejudicial to the surety will discharge the surety”. The reason
    for this strict rule is that since the surety is understandably
    concerned about transactions involving the principal debtor, the
    creditor must inform and consult him. The surety is not discharged
    if the principal contract allowed for variations or if the surety
    had consented, such as through a clause in the guarantee, to
    the variation. Note, however, that a clause in the guarantee may not
    justify a radical change.
-   **Alteration of Terms of Guarantee:-** If the creditor deliberately
    alters the instrument of guarantee in any material particular
    without the consent of the surety, the instrument will become void
    and the surety will be discharged.
-   **Departure from Terms of Guarantee:** If the creditor departs from
    or breaches a term in the guarantee, whether the surety is
    discharged depends on the seriousness of the breach. If it is a
    serious breach, the surety is fully discharged whereas if it is not
    serious, then the surety is discharged only to the extent that he
    suffered prejudice.
-   **Agreement to Give Time to Principal Debtor:** It is a strict
    principle of suretyship law that an agreement to give time to the
    principal debtor discharges the surety if it was made without the
    surety´s consent, whether or not the surety is prejudiced by it. The
    technical reason is that this agreement interferes with the surety´s
    right to pay the creditor and sue the principal debtor.
-   **Agreement with Principal Debtor to Give Time to Surety:** Where
    the creditor agrees with the principal debtor to give time to the
    surety, the surety is discharged. The reason is that such an
    agreement ties the hands of the creditor from receiving payment from
    the surety and therefore interferes with the surety´s right to pay
    the debt and sue the principal debtor.
-   **Release of Principal Debtor:** A release of the principal debtor
    discharges the surety, for the same technical reason that his right
    to pay the debt and sue the principal debtor is interfered with. The
    surety is not discharged if the contract of guarantee
    provides otherwise.
-   **Release of Surety:** Obviously, if the creditor chooses to release
    the surety, the latter is discharged from liability.
-   **Release of Co-Surety:** A release of a co-surety discharges the
    surety, the reason being that such release may prejudice his right
    of contribution from the co-surety.
-   **Release or Loss of Securities:** Where the existence of the
    security is a condition of the guarantee, the release or loss of the
    security by the creditor fully discharges the surety. Where there is
    no such condition, the release or loss discharges the surety only to
    the extent that he has been prejudiced. The creditor, however, is
    probably not under a duty to the surety to realize a security before
    it became worthless; the creditor is free to decide whether or not
    to realize security, and if so, when.
-   **Negligent Realization:** While a creditor is not under a duty to
    enforce securities held by him, if he does enforce any such
    securities, he owes a duty to the surety to take reasonable care in
    enforcing them. He is under a duty to realize the securities at the
    \`best possible price´ or the \`true market value´, at the time he
    realizes them.
-   **General Duty not to Prejudice the Surety:** There is some
    authority for a general proposition that if the creditor does any
    act which is injurious to the surety or inconsistent with the
    surety´s rights, the surety is discharged.
-   **Clauses Taking Away Surety´s Defences:** Most standard form
    guarantees contain clauses that seek to preserve the surety´s
    liability in every scenario where the surety would have been
    discharged on account of the creditor´s conduct. While such clauses
    are generally effective, it is possible that in some situations they
    may amount to unreasonable exclusion clauses under the Unfair
    Contract Terms Act (Cap 396).
-   **Avoidance of Guarantee:** Like any contract, a guarantee can be
    avoided because of vitiating factors such as misrepresentation,
    undue influence, and illegality.
-   **Non-Disclosure:** It is well established that unlike contracts of
    insurance, a contract of guarantee is not a contract uberrimae fidei
    - there is no obligation on the part of the creditor to disclose to
    an intending surety all material facts of which the creditor
    is aware. Instead, the creditor has a duty to disclose unusual facts
    or, put in another way, anything that might not naturally be
    expected to take place between the parties. It has recently been
    said that \`a creditor is obliged to disclose to a guarantor any
    unusual feature of the contract between the creditor and the debtor
    which makes it materially different in a potentially disadvantageous
    respect from what the guarantor might naturally expect´.

-   **Misrepresentation, Undue Influence and Unsconcionability:** A
    guarantee may be avoided on account of the creditor´s vitiating
    conduct in inducing the other party to give the guarantee, such as
    through misrepresentation, undue influence and unconscionability.
    Misrepresentation involves the false statement of a material fact to
    induce the other party. Undue influence refers to the improper use
    of pressure or influence. Unconscionability involves the
    exploitation of a person´s disadvantage or disability to achieve an
    oppressive result. If the creditor uses any of these forms of
    improper conduct to induce the guarantee to be given, the guarantee
    may be avoided.
-   **Principal Debtor´s Vitiating Conduct:** In the context of
    guarantees, the vitiating conduct that is likely to occur is not so
    much that of the creditor but rather that of the principal debtor
    towards the surety. The typical scenario is where a debtor-husband
    through some vitiating conduct induces his wife to stand as surety
    (or mortgagor) for him. The difficulty here is in deciding which of
    the two apparently innocent parties is deserving of the law´s
    protection - the surety or the creditor. The recent two decades have
    seen significant developments in this area of law. The current
    position, after two landmark House of Lords decisions, appears to be
    as that the creditor is affected by the principal debtor´s
    misconduct towards the surety if: (a) the principal debtor was the
    creditor´s agent in securing the surety´s consent to giving the
    guarantee; or
    \(b) the creditor had actual or constructive notice of the principal
    debtor´s impropriety.

-   **Constructive Notice:** The constructive notice concept used here
    needs elaboration. A creditor who is \`put on inquiry´ as to the
    impropriety is required to take reasonable steps to ensure that the
    surety understands the nature and effect of the transaction;
    otherwise he is affixed with constructive notice. A creditor is said
    to be put on inquiry by a combination of two factors - the
    transaction not being to the financial advantage of the surety, and
    substantial risk of the debtor committing wrong in procuring
    the guarantee.
-   **Reasonable Steps:** The creditor has to take reasonable steps
    either through a private meeting with the surety or through
    obtaining confirmation from a solicitor acting for the surety. There
    are elaborate requirements and qualifications with regard to the
    steps that should be taken.
-   **Wider Propositions:** In addition to these principles, there is
    weighty dicta for two wider propositions of law: that the creditor
    is put on inquiry whenever a wife soley stands as surety for her
    husband´s debts, and that a creditor is put on inquiry in respect of
    all non-commercial sureties.
-   **Avoidance of Corporate Guarantees:** A corporate guarantee may be
    avoided on account of it being ultra vires the company i.e., beyond
    the company's capacity. In addition, the Companies Act (cap 50)
    prohibits a company from giving a guarantee: for the purpose of the
    purchase by any person of shares in the company or in its holding
    company; for the benefit of a director of the company or a related
    company; or for the benefit of a company that is connected to the
    directors of the company giving the guarantee. However, the
    respective contraventions have differing effects on the
    enforceability of the guarantee.

### Rights of Surety [^13]

The main rights of a surety are: the right of indemnity as against the
principal debtor, the right of subrogation as against the creditor and
the right of contribution as against co-sureties.

-   **Right against Principal Debtor:** There are two main bases upon
    which a surety may claim against the principal debtor - indemnity
    and restitution. The indemnity basis applies whenever there is as
    between the principal debtor and the surety an express or implied
    agreement that the former will indemnify the latter from all losses
    incurred as a result of giving the guarantee. Upon paying the
    principal debt, the surety is entitled at law to exercise his right
    of indemnity. When the creditor makes a demand on the surety, it
    would be prudent for the surety to inform or consult the principal
    debtor as:

a.  It helps the surety to confirm that there has been default;
b.  It helps the surety to ascertain whether the principal debtor has
    any defences, **and**

    > c\. The principal debtor may in response give specific instructions to
    > the surety or even assume responsibility of defending the action.

-   **Indemnity Rights:** In equity, even before payment, the surety has
    indemnity rights. As soon as the surety´s liability to pay under the
    guarantee has become absolute in that the creditor has acquired a
    right to immediate payment by the surety, the surety is entitled to
    call upon the principal debtor to pay the debt in order to relieve
    the surety of such liability. The surety proceeds by way of a \`quia
    timet´ action (literally, \`because he fears´).
-   **Restitutionary Rights:** The second basis is restitution. The
    restitutionary claim does not depend on any express or implied
    indemnity on the part of the principal debtor. Rather, the principle
    is that where the plaintiff has paid money which the defendant is
    liable to pay, so that the defendant has obtained a benefit by the
    discharge of his liability, the defendant is indebted to the
    plaintiff in that amount. Note, however, that the surety should not
    have \`officiously´ assumed responsibility. A surety is officious if
    it was not reasonably necessary in his interests to
    assume responsibility.
-   **Rights against Creditor:** A surety who has paid the creditor has
    the right of subrogation, meaning that he is entitled to all the
    rights of the creditor in respect of the debt. This means, most
    importantly, that he is entitled to all the securities which the
    creditor received from the principal debtor or from a co-surety,
    whether the securities were given before or after the suretyship was
    entered into and whether or not the surety was at the time aware of
    their existence. An unrequested surety probably has
    subrogation rights. Apart from subrogation rights, a surety also has
    certain rights which may be exercised even before payment of
    the debt.
-   **Rights against Co-sureties:** A surety who has paid more than his
    share of the debt has a right of contribution against
    the co-sureties. Possibly, before payment, he has quia timet rights
    against his co-sureties. Co-sureties share their liability in
    accordance with what was set out in the guarantee. Failing such
    stipulation, the principle is that if each is a surety for an equal
    amount, they contribute equally whereas if they are liable for
    different amounts, they contribute proportionately. It would be
    prudent for a surety to consult his co-sureties before making any
    payment to the creditor.
-   **Rights of Set-off:** In addition to the abovementioned rights,
    there are also rights of set-off. Three forms of set-offs are of
    interest here: legal set-off, equitable set-off and
    insolvency set-off. Legal set-off is available whereas between the
    plaintiff and the defendant there are mutual claims (that is,
    between the same parties and in the same capacities) which are
    liquidated and due and payable. Equitable set-off is available where
    the defendant´s cross-claim is closely connected with the
    plaintiff´s claim and applies whether or not the two claims
    are liquidated. Insolvency set-off is an automatic set-off of mutual
    debts as between a bankrupt and his creditors. The result of a
    set-off is that the original claim is cancelled out or reduced by
    the cross-claim. Set-off may apply to guarantees, for example where:
    a.  The creditor has a claim on the guarantee against a surety who
        has a cross-claim against him;
    b.  The surety has an indemnity claim against the principal debtor
        who has a cross-claim against him; or
    c.  The surety has a contribution claim against a co-surety who has
        a cross-claim against him.

A surety may also be able to invoke the right of set-off which the
principal debtor (or a co-surety) has against the creditor, although
this is a matter of some debate.

**Can I act as a guarantor if I am declared bankrupt?** [^14]

Not likely.

As a bankrupt, your assets become vested in the Official Assignee and
divisible among your creditors; hence, your assets, already insufficient
to cover your existing debts, are protected for their benefit and cannot
further be depleted by your act of incurring additional liability by
acting as a guarantor. Further, you will be required to disclose your
bankruptcy status if you are obtaining credit of more than S\$500 from
others; hence, it is highly unlikely that the creditor would consider
your guarantee.

You must take note that in any case, as a bankrupt, you must seek the
necessary permissions and disclose the relevant information relating to
your affairs to the Official Assignee. Hence, you must first seek such
permission before attempting to undertake potential further financial
liability.

After your discharge from bankruptcy, you may apply for loans and credit
facilities, including acting as a guarantor. **However, the decision of
whether or not to grant credit lies with the credit grantor.** A credit
grantor would, before granting any credit, consider the creditworthiness
of the applicant by reviewing their past records.

### ENQUIRIES RELATING TO DISCHARGE OF BANKRUPTCY

**How long will it take to discharge bankruptcy? What is the fastest way
to discharge from bankruptcy?**

According to the IPTO, the process to obtain a discharge generally takes
at least six months and varies depending on the complexity of the case.

### ENQUIRIES RELATING TO POST-DISCHARGE OF BANKRUPTCY

**Can my bankruptcy records be expunged?**

Bankruptcy Orders are made by High Court. Notification on bankruptcy
orders and discharges are information available in the public domain
which the OA has no power to expunge. However, the OA will remove the
bankruptcy information from the IPTO’s online insolvency search service
6 years after a bankrupt is discharged from bankruptcy and the Supreme
Court’s records will also have evidence of the discharge.

**Can a discharged bankrupt apply for loans or credit cards after being
discharged from bankruptcy?**

After the discharge of a bankrupt, the decision whether to grant credit
or not lies with the credit grantor. A credit grantor would, before
granting any credit, determine the creditworthiness of credit applicants
by reviewing their past records.

### OTHER ENQUIRIES

**I'm a professional and have been bankrupted. Am I immediately
disqualified from practising?**

Yes.

If you are a solicitor, accountant, architect, or surveyor, you will be
immediately disqualified from continuing in your professional capacity
upon your being adjudged a bankrupt.

In the case of an insolvent solicitor, he/ she will be disqualified from
practice and barred from applying for a practice certificate. If the
practicing certificate has already been issued, it will cease to be
valid upon the insolvency of the solicitor concerned. The insolvent
solicitor will also be subject to disciplinary action, particularly if
he/ she is guilty of any one of the acts/ omissions specified in Section
124(5) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20).

**Can I apply for free legal assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau?**

It may be possible for you to apply for free legal assistance from the
Legal Aid Bureau. However, if your income exceeds the limit prescribed
by the Legal Aid Bureau, you may be precluded from applying for legal
aid. For more information on legal aid, you can visit the Legal Aid
Bureau's website at <http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/> or call them at the
toll-free hotline: [1800 325 1424](tel:18003251424).

**Are there laws which govern high interest rates? How do I appeal if I
feel I’m being charged overly high interest rates?**

Under Section 94(1) of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20), for the purposes
of dividend distribution, where a debt which has been proved in a
bankruptcy includes interest payments then the same shall be calculated
at no more than 8% per annum as per Section 185 of the Bankruptcy Rules.
Section 184 of the Bankruptcy Rules also provides for a maximum interest
rate of 8% per annum when the interest due to the creditor is
unspecified.

With regards to loans made by moneylenders, Section 21 of the
Moneylenders Act (Chapter 188) sets out that where a debt due to a
moneylender in respect of a loan includes interest, that interest shall,
for the purposes of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20),
be calculated at a rate not exceeding 4% per annum.

Where these rates are exceeded, inform your OA immediately.

**I have outstanding payments for a car loan, do I still have to pay it
even if I surrender the car?**

Yes. Voluntary surrender means that you volunteer to give the car back
to the finance company but still have to pay what you owe - your debt
does not disappear with the car. You sign a voluntary surrender form,
the finance company sells the car and the money they get goes towards
your debt but you will still have to make repayments until the entire
debt is paid off.
